    <p><h1>Theodore Gray on the Use of Thimerosal in Vaccines </h1>
        “At one point, while looking for an explanation for rising rates of childhood autism, attention focused on thimerosal, which actually looks quite scary as a molecule. Notice the mercury in the middle? It’s bound to some organic groups.The part on the right is thiosalicylic acid, which is essentially aspirin witha sulfur atom. The bit on the left is the really scary part: That’s an ethylgroup (two carbons). If you split the mercury – sulfur bond, you’re left withan ethylmercury ion. If that doesn’t cause you to feel just a bit of panic, you don’t fully understand the situation.

        Dimethylmercury and diethylmercury accumulate in the brain and cause serious nervous damage even in low concentrations. They are among the most neurotoxic substances known. They’reretained in the body for a long time and tend to add up, so any exposure is a problem. They also accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals. Some of the mercury emitted by, for example, coal-fired power plants, eventually gets transformed into these sorts of compounds and then works its way back to us in the form of, for example, tuna fish. For this and other reasons, great efforts should be expended to limit the release of mercury into the environment. But neither of these compounds come from thimerosal. It just looks like they might.

        When thimerosal is broken down in the body, one product is the ethylmercury ion. That’s terrifying. Were it to be transformed in some way into diethylmercury or any other similar organomercury compound, it could be a real problem. But all indications are that this just doesn’t happen. The situation has been investigated in tremendous detail, and it seems quite definitely the case that this ion iscleared from the body in a period of a few weeks. It doesn’t have time to go throughthe sorts of transformation that happen to mercury left out in the environment for years. You wouldn’t want to take in large quantities of ethylmercury ions for an extended period – that would be tempting fate because some amount of it could get stuck long enough to cause harm. But half a dozen tiny doses over a lifetime? No, that’s not a problem.

        Even though it seems to be entirely harmless, why is thimerosal present in vaccines in the first place? Why not just solve the problem by taking it out? In 1928, twelve of twenty-one children given a diphtheria vaccine (without thimerosal) died of bacterial infection. That’s the kind of thing that gets people’s attention. Thimerosal is and was the only substance known to preserve vaccine potency in multidose vials while preventing dangerous infectious organism contamination. If you want to be able to give vaccinations on a worldwide scale in a cost-effective way, you have two choices – use thimerosal or don’t. And if you choose the latter, you will watch children die from infections that could have been prevented. The antivaccine crowd recklessly suggested that we just stop giving vaccines altogether. But we didn’t start administering vaccines without reason! It’simpossible to count how many people have died of now – preventable diseases,such as diphtheria, before vaccines were available, but in the modern age alone it’s in the hundreds of millions.
        
        There is a simple way to avoid using thimerosal: give all vaccinations from single – dose vials, effectively eliminating the possibility of contamination. Sounds great, right? It is, but only if you’re rich. In fact, in an unnecessary response to pressure from the antivaccination movement, thimerosal basically isn’t used anymore in child – hood vaccines in countries wealthy enough to be able to administer single –dose vials. But in poor countries, where thousands of children die every day from preventable diseases, multidose vials that contain thimerosal, which won’t harm them anyway, are the only sensible option."</p>
